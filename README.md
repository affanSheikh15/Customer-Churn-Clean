# üß† Customer Churn Prediction

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict **customer churn** for a telecom company using machine learning. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) so that proactive retention strategies can be implemented. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready serialization.


### üß© Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Handling missing values and outliers
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Feature scaling and transformation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Distribution analysis
   * Correlation matrix visualization
   * Churn ratio and customer behavior insights

3. **Modeling:**
   * Multiple algorithms tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   * Hyperparameter tuning for optimal accuracy

4. **Evaluation:**
   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   * Model comparison and final selection

5. **Model Export:**
   * Final model and preprocessing pipeline saved using `.joblib`


### üìä Results
The final **XGBoost pipeline** achieved strong predictive performance with:

* High accuracy on validation data
* Balanced precision and recall for churn detection
* Generalized performance across unseen test samples

### üöÄ Future Improvements
* Integrate model into a **web dashboard (Streamlit or Flask)**
* Add **automated retraining pipeline** with new data
* Explore **deep learning** or **ensemble stacking** for higher accuracy
